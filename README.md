# System Integrity Management Platform (SIMP)

## IMPORTANT

This project is only approved for material that is completely releasable to the
public.

**Please do not upload material that has not been approved for public release.**

# **MIGRATION IN PROGRESS**

Please be aware that this project is in the process of transitioning legacy
code into GitHub. It may take quite some time before we have a fully functional
system available for immediate download.

We appreciate both your interest and your patience during this period.

You can follow our progress at our [JIRA](https://simp-project.atlassian.net) page.

# Where's the code?!

For those out there that just want the goods, the actual code for the SIMP
project is hosted under the [SIMP GitHub Organization](https://github.com/simp).

## Description

SIMP is a framework that aims to provide a reasonable combination of security
compliance and operational flexibility.

The ultimate goal of the project is to provide a complete management
environment focused on compliance with the various profiles in the
[SCAP Security Guide Project](https://fedorahosted.org/scap-security-guide/) and industry best practice.

Though it is fully capable out of the box, the intent of SIMP is to be molded
to your target environment in such a way that deviations are easily identifiable
to both Operations Teams and Security Officers.

At this time, there are no commercial requirements for the use of SIMP outside
of the purchase of [Red Hat Enterprise Linux](http://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux) licenses as applicable.
